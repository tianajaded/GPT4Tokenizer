# GPT4Tokenizer

# Overview
This project involves building a tokenizer for the GPT4 language model from scratch using Python. The tokenizer is a crucial preprocessing step that converts raw text into manageable tokens, allowing for efficient processing and storage.

# Features
Efficient Text Processing: Converts large volumes of raw text into tokens, reducing computational load and storage requirements.
Customizable Training Sets: Allows for separate training sets for the tokenizer and the language model, improving contextual understanding and training efficiency.
Multi-language Support: Designed to handle various languages, enhancing token diversity and representation.
